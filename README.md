# Votehash
An electronic voting app which is integrated with Azure workbench 
Our application is to build a solution towards the issue of:
### Living in a different location -
 Our application initially opens up with the screen containing options of login as Administrator or a voter.
 Moving on with Voter, he or she can just scan their voter ID card to get the number and then redirected to 
 the page containing the list of Candidates to be voted for in their area based upon the constituency address.
 In such a case the voter needs to have his Aadhar card which will be scanned.
 Thus , voters are allowed to vote safely

### More safety
 In an online mode , voters need not be afraid of the parties and can vote upto their freedom.

### One Voter One Vote
 With a voter ID card , a voter can vote only once. For more safety , we are going to check the IP address of the
 device . Furthermore, there will be a feature of fingerprint with which the voter can vote.
 [There are several insecurity with fingerprints these days too]
 With time other security features will be added to it.
